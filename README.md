Earning Report is a web app that shows you how releases of equities' earnings affected their stock pricing. 
Even Yahoo! Finance or TD Ameritrade doesn't come with such fancy services, so I decided to build one for the public to use.

As an options trader, it's very important to know how much percentage changes after earning report released on a specific equity. It helps options traders construct the option trading strategies. 

# Updates
- Current Pain <a href="options-er.herokuapp.com">options-er.herokuapp.com</a> is up. Current Pain is trying to predict what price a certain equity is going to land at the end of the trading day.


# Stretch Goals

- Based on historical data, providing optimal options trading strategies;
- Each equity will come along with a put/call ratio chart;
- When you search an equity's upcoming earning report dates, we will show you its competitors earning report results.
